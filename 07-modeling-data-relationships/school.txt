What classes/entites do we need to model?

 We need to model the student and class entities.

What fields/attributes will each entity need?

  classes will have id, subject, teacher, class code, room, time
  students will have id, first name, last name, phone number, email address

What data types do we need to use?

  For classes, id, and room will be integers, subject teacher and code will be
  text and time will be time.
  For students, id and phone number will be integers and first name, last name
  and email address will be text.

What relationships exist between entities?

  There will be a many to many relationship between teachers and students.

How should those relationships be represented in tables?

  The relationships would be represented with an enrolments table containing
  the studentid as a foreign key representing the id field in the students table
  and the classid as a foreign key representing the id field in the class table.

Assumptions made:

  - Students will be enrolled in man classes, classes will have many students.
  - Students will have a first and last name, email address, which will be text
  and a phone number which will be an int.
  - Classes will have a subject, teacher, class code as text, room number as int,
  and time as time.
